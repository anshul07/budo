This lab demonstrates 
	1. A stubbed proxy, i.e., no backend. Request headers are echoed.  This is done by setting no element in   <RouteRule name="default"/>
	2. It does not really need the target folder and its content (except UI validation needs these to display the bundle properly)
	3. adds a new header, places static body
